# This file aims to prevent the crawling and indexing of certain parts of your site by
# webcrawlers and spiders run by sites like Yahoo! and Google. By telling
# these "robots" where not to go on your site, you save bandwidth and server
# resources, and the quality of their crawling and indexing is improved as well.
#
# For more information about the robots.txt standard, see:
# http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html
#
# To stop a polite robot from indexing an exampledir,
# add an uncommented line (without #), like the following:
#
# user-agent: polite-bot
# Disallow: /exampledir/

# A list of known 'bots can be found at:
# http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/active/html/index.html
#
# See this site for syntax checking:
# http://www.sxw.org.uk/computing/robots/check.html
